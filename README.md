This project explores the concept of Six Degrees of Separation within Facebook’s social network using Breadth-First Search (BFS). The Six Degrees of Separation theory suggests that any two people are, on average, six or fewer social connections away from each other. By applying BFS, we analyze how closely connected users are within the Facebook graph.

	•	Utilizes the BFS algorithm to traverse and analyze the Facebook social graph.
	•	Calculates the degrees of separation between various pairs of users.
	•	Tests the Six Degrees of Separation theory in the context of Facebook’s social network.
